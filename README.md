### Notes

* In a few problems (1-2) I do copy paste code from stackoverflow, but it's because I already know the algorithm plus I'm too lazy to actually type it. If you don't like this deal with it.
* Indeed, my scripts are not that fancy, neat or super fast like I always do. But it's because I just want to get the work done.
